# Content Report React Module

A comprehensive content reporting tool for Jahia DX, built with React and the Moonstone UI library. This module provides powerful insights into your Jahia site's content through various customizable reports.

## Overview

The Content Report React module offers a modern, user-friendly interface for generating and viewing detailed reports about your Jahia site content. It features a site overview dashboard and multiple specialized reports covering content, languages, visibility, metadata, and system information.

## Features

### 📊 Site Overview Dashboard
- **Content Metrics**: Pages, deployed modules, registered users, content nodes (`jnt:content`), editorial contents (`jmix:editorialContent`)
- **Workflow Tracking**: Pending workflow tasks count
- **Asset Management**: Files (`jnt:file`) and Images (`jmix:image`) counts
- **Language Support**: Available site languages count with visual display
- **Content Activity (Last 30 Days)**:
  - New content created
  - Modified content items
  - Published content items
  - Published vs Unpublished nodes comparison
  - Average time from creation to publication
  - Top contributors ranked by content count (with medal badges 🥇🥈🥉)
  - **Detailed activity log**: a collapsible table listing the content behind those
    counters — every `jmix:editorialContent` node created, modified or published in the
    window, with its creation, last-modification and last-publication dates and the user
    responsible for each. Tags mark which of the three events actually fell inside the
    window. Sortable on any column, filterable per event type, paginated, exportable to
    CSV or JSON, and each path links straight into jContent. Capped at the 500 most
    recently touched items, with the full total reported alongside.

    Rows are read with the caller's own JCR session, so the table only ever lists content
    the current user is allowed to see.

### 📝 Content Reports
- **By Author and Date**: Filter pages or all content by combining author and date range criteria; supports creation vs. modification date toggle
- **By Author**: List content created or last modified by a specific author
- **By All Dates**: Break down content activity per month and type, with creation or modification date scope
- **Before Date**: List content created or modified before a given date
- **By Type**: Analyze content distribution grouped by node type
- **By Type (Detailed)**: Same as By Type with additional per-node detail rows
- **By Status**: View content filtered by publication status
- **Work in Progress**: Content marked as WIP — still being edited, not ready for publication
- **Workflow Instances**: All content with a pending workflow task (awaiting review, approval, or publication)
- **Marked for Deletion**: Content flagged for removal, including child node counts and publication status

### 🔗 References Reports
- **References**: Content references between two paths — only shows content actually used on a page
- **Unused Assets**: Files under a chosen path that are not referenced anywhere in the site, with MIME type icons and direct media folder links

### 🌍 Language Reports
- **Languages**: Content breakdown across all site languages
- **Language Detail**: Per-language detail for a specific target language
- **Pages Without Title**: Pages missing a title in one or more languages
- **Untranslated Content**: Content existing in other languages but missing a translation for the selected target language

### 👁️ Visibility Reports
- **Live Visibility Conditions**: Content with active conditional visibility rules, showing conditions, match status, and current visibility state
- **Expired Content**: Content whose visibility end date has already passed (no longer live)
- **Scheduled Content**: Content with a future visibility start date not yet reached

### 🔍 Metadata Reports
- **Pages Without Keywords**: Pages missing SEO keyword metadata
- **Pages Without Description**: Pages missing descriptions in one or more languages

### 👥 Users & Groups Report
- **Report Users & Groups**: Generate a CSV report of all Jahia users across all sites, including group memberships; reports are stored in JCR and downloadable directly from the page

### ⚙️ System Reports
- **Locked Content**: All content currently locked by users, showing creator, lock holder, and location
- **Custom Cache Content**: Content with custom cache expiration settings, showing expiration values to help optimize cache performance
- **ACL Inheritance Break**: Nodes where ACL inheritance has been broken (custom permissions overriding parent), useful for security auditing
- **Modules deployed on site**: Every module deployed on the site with its version, type, bundle state and how it got there (template set, installed on the site, or transitive dependency), plus the number of component types each one declares
- **Component usage**: For each deployed module, every component type it declares and how many nodes of exactly that type exist under the site — zero-usage components included, so unused components are easy to find (sort the usage column ascending)

## Requirements

- **Jahia DX**: 8.2.0.0 or higher

public class MyCustomReport extends QueryReport {
    @Override
    public String getId() {
        return "myReport";
    }
    
    @Override
    protected String buildQuery(Map<String, String> parameters) {
        // Build JCR SQL-2 query
        return "SELECT * FROM [jnt:page] WHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE('" + path + "')";
    }
}
```

```

### Adding a New Report

1. **Define Report Configuration** (`AdminPanel.constants.js`):
   ```javascript
   {
       id: 'newReport',
       labelKey: 'menu.newReport',
       type: 'legacy',
       category: 'content',
       fields: [...],
       columns: [...]
   }
   ```

2. **Add Translations** (`en.json`, `fr.json`):
   ```json
   {
       "menu": {
           "newReport": "New Report"
       },
       "descriptions": {
           "newReport": "Description of the new report"
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Create Backend Report** (Java):
   ```java
   @Component
   public class ReportNewReport extends QueryReport {
       @Override
       public String getId() {
           return "newReport";
       }
       
       @Override
       protected String buildQuery(Map<String, String> parameters) {
           // Implement query logic
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Build and Test**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install -DskipTests
   ```

## GraphQL API

The module exposes GraphQL queries for accessing reports:

```graphql
query {
  admin {
    contentReports {
      overview(siteKey: "/sites/mysite", language: "en") {
        siteName
        nbPages
        nbContents
        nbFiles
        nbImages
        languages
        # Content Activity (Last 30 Days)
        newContentLast30Days
        modifiedContentLast30Days
        publishedContentLast30Days
        unpublishedNodes
        publishedNodes
        averageTimeToPublish
        topContributors {
          username
          contentCount
        }
        # Detailed activity log — capped at 500 rows, most recent first
        recentActivityTotal
        recentActivity {
          name
          path
          type
          created
          createdBy
          lastModified
          lastModifiedBy
          lastPublished
          lastPublishedBy
          isNew
          isModified
          isPublished
        }
      }
      rawReport(
        siteKey: "mysite"
        language: "en"
        reportId: "20"
        offset: 0
        limit: 100
        parameterName1: "pathTxt"
        parameterValue1: "/sites/mysite"
      )
    }
  }
}
```

## Technologies

### Frontend
- **React** 18.2.0: UI framework
- **Moonstone** 2.16.2: Jahia's design system
- **i18next**: Internationalization
- **Axios**: HTTP client
- **Webpack** 5: Module bundler

### Backend
- **Java** 11: Backend language
- **GraphQL**: API layer (graphql-java-annotations)
- **JCR**: Content repository queries
- **Spring**: Dependency injection
- **OSGi**: Module framework

## Performance Considerations

- Reports use `rep:count(item, skipChecks=1)` for efficient counting
- Client-side pagination for large datasets (default limit: 10,000)
- Lazy loading of report results
- Optimized JCR queries with proper indexing

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**Problem**: Frontend build fails
```bash
yarn clean:all
yarn install
mvn clean install
```

**Problem**: Java compilation errors
- Ensure Java 11+ is installed
- Check Jahia parent POM version compatibility

### Runtime Issues

**Problem**: Reports return no data
- Verify user has read permissions on content
- Check JCR query syntax in logs
- Ensure site key and language are correct

**Problem**: Path picker not working
- Verify Content Editor API is available
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Debugging

Enable debug logging in Jahia:
```
log4j.logger.org.jahia.modules.contentreports=DEBUG
```
